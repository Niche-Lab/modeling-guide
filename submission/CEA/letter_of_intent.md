# [Letter of Intent] VSI: Agricultural Cybernetics

Dear Drs. Yanbo Huang, Lie Tang, Lirong Xiang, and Jiajia Li,

I am writing to express my intention to submit a manuscript for consideration in the Call for Papers for the Special Issue, Agricultural Cybernetics, in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture. I, an Assistant Professor of Animal Data Science, along with my colleague Dr. Robin White (who is cc'ed in this email), have developed a manuscript initially intended for internal training within our institution.

The manuscript is attached to this email for your reference. The manuscript, tentatively titled "A Guide on Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Model Performance Metrics and Validation,‚Äù focuses on an overview of metric definitions and applications and introduces three common pitfalls in the cross-validation process. This topic is critical for ensuring the reproducibility and comparability of machine learning (ML) studies regardless of the field. Given the journal's emphasis on data-driven agricultural practices, we believe that our manuscript can offer valuable guidelines for both the readers and authors of the journal.

Should you find our manuscript a suitable fit for the Special Issue, we are prepared to further expand (or trim) and refine it to meet the journal's standards. We are willing to collaborate closely with the editorial team to ensure our manuscript aligns well with the focus of the Special Issue. We are also open to feedback and suggestions to better tailor our work to the expectations of the journal.

Thank you for considering our submission. We eagerly anticipate your feedback and hope for the opportunity to contribute to this publication.

Sincerely,
James
