# Block Cross Validation

In experimental design, blocking is an essentail approach to cotnrol for variation that can confound the primary effects of interest. For example, when investigating milk production of individual cow, day of lactation should be a blocking facotr (ref) since it is known to change over the course of lactation, and the individual performance may be confounded with the effect of lactation day. Considering the variation of blocking factor may contribute to the trait of interest, a validation strategy that takes into account the blocking factor is needed.
