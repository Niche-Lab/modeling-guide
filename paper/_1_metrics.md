# Performance Metrics

Performance metrics is an indicator to quantify model performance. It is used as a tool to benchmark different modeling strategies and to justify the hypotehsis. Depends on the examined hypothesis, an optimistic evaluation can be concluded if the metrics are not appropriately selected. This section will briefly introduce the common metrics used in the dairy science literature and dicuss potential pitfalls.

## Regression

A regression model is a type of model that predict a continuous variable. Regression model is often applied in estimating milk composition, yield, feed efficiency, and even environmental impacts. There are plenty of metrics that can be used in a regression task. This section focuses on three common metrics: root mean squared error (RMSE), Pearson's Correlation Coefficient ($r^2$), and coefficient of determination ($R^2$).

To better illustrate the idea, a hypothetical example is provided (Figure 1). 

### Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$
