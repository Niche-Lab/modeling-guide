# Performance Metrics

Performance metrics serve as quantitative indicators for evaluating model performance. They are essential tools for benchmarking various modeling approaches and validating hypotheses. However, it's important to note that the choice of metrics can significantly influence the evaluation results. Depending on the specific hypothesis being tested, an overly optimistic assessment may be concluded if inappropriate metrics are selected. This section aims to introduce commonly used performance metrics in the field of dairy science and discuss potential pitfalls that researchers should be cautious of.
