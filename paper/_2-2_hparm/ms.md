Use cross validation wrap-up function to do the cross validation in the inner loop.


The accuracy of the kernel machine on test data is critically dependent on the choice of good values for the hyper-parameters, in this case λ and 


The search for the optimal values for such hyper- parameters is a process known as model selection. The representer theorem
